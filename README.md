# Wedding Website Template

This site is a lightweight wedding website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is based on [Ram Patra's Wedding Website Project](https://github.com/rampatra/wedding-website) which provided the original design and functionality. The look and content here have been updated for our celebration.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Build the assets by running `npx gulp`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.

## Customisation

Update the images in the `img` directory and edit the text inside `index.html` to personalise the website for your own event.
